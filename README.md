# Should I Stay or Should I GO

## About
### Intro
This project will start by following Sentdex YouTube tutorial's on Go programming, beginning with [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3PvTWRIhZA&vl=en). Eventually this project will extend beyond these tutorials into its own, unique thing.

Sentdex tutorials are led by Harrison Kinsley. Harrison Kinsley's tutorials were a fantastic reference for me to learn Python, and so far Go is no different!

If I'm going to **Go**, I will be having fun with some puns. Check out [these great songs](https://www.ranker.com/list/the-best-songs-with-go-in-the-title/ranker-music) to **Go** listen to!

Who sings the song this project is named after?

### Background
Go is a programming language. It was designed by Google as a more pleasant alternative to write than C++.

Why Go?

This language is beneficial for scale, and makes apps speedy and efficient without writing in C++. Go can help you make gains in web development: it increases speed for better user experience and decreases processing and hosting cost.

Like C++ and Java, Go is static typed. You tell it the types of your variables, and it will forever be that type (such as strings, integers, and floats). This is unlike Ruby, Python, and JavaScript, where the interpreter has to figure out the type every time it comes a crossed a variable, and that type can change. This gives you speed.

Go is built for concurrency, meaning that different parts of a program can be executed in parallel. This also gives you speed.

Like C++ and Java, Go is a compiled language. This means that it is directly translated to machine-level code that can be read and executed by a computer instead of being interpreted each time the application is run. Interpreted languages, like JavaScript, have to be read and executed by another program.

## Getting Started
Check out [Go](https://golang.org/) and [download it](https://golang.org/dl/).

To run & compile: `$ go run file.go`, where file is replaced by the file you want to run, such as `youtube_notes/go_note_1.go`
